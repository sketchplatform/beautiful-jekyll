https://www.edx.org/course/big-data-analysis-apache-spark-uc-berkeleyx-cs110x 
### [Free] Big Data Analysis with Revolution R Enterprise.(You might just want to sign up for Datacamp.com and learn about R and Python)
https://www.datacamp.com/community/open-courses/big-data-revolution-r-enterprise-tutorial#gs.CcNTftQ 
### EMC Data Science and Big Data 
https://education.emc.com/guest/campaign/data_science.aspx 
### CS 345) Data Management
Learn about SQL, Queries, Database, Data related about the Web Schema Design, and Data Visualization.
### CS 397F) Special Topic Data Science (easy and could be helpful)
Learn about R, Basic Data Wrangling and Visualization, and Some Machine Learning
### CS 445) Information Systems (helpful, but may be difficult)
It will cover the relational model, conceptual design, and query languages. We will also cover core database implementation issues including storage and indexing, query processing and optimization, and transaction management. In presenting advanced data management technology, ut will cover web application development, big data analytics, and cloud computing. 
### Big Data & Hadoop Developer Training (probably not worth the money)

## What is the difference between data science and big data?

- Data Science looks to create models that capture the underlying patterns of complex systems, and codify those models into working applications. (smaller data analyzed with careful analysis, write applications to gain further insight.)

- Big Data looks to collect and manage large amounts of varied data to serve large-scale web applications and vast sensor networks. (large database usually large system or data maintenance,  optimization, and analysis)
