The general term for Informatics is the science of information and computer systems. However for me Informatics stands for much more than the science of information.
Informatics is a field that connects people with the ability to communicate about Data, Technology and Intelligence. You take the foundation of computer science and join
them together with statistics and business. These concepts work together in synergy to form what we call "Informatics." In my school there are two types of Informatics;
one focuses only on multimedia while the other focuses only on data. Informatics also divides itself into seperate categories such as BioInformatics, IT informatics, and research informatics

But for Informatics (Data Science) the common roles are:

- Data Scientist
- Data Analyst
- Analyst
- Software Engineers
- Data Engineers
- UI / UX Design
