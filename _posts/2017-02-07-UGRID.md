UGRiD stands for "Undergraduate Researchers Interested in Data". It's a group that consists of Five College students from cross-interdisciplinary backgrounds who have an interest in Data Science. This semester, we'll be preparing for an annual data competition called Datafest. We primarily work with R Programming and don't worry if you're new to the language. We will provide you with information and a set of tools to help you get started. We will also be hosting workshops and guest lecturers here on campus.
