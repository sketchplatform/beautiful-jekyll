title: What is UGRiD?
---

UGRiD stands for "Undergraduate Researchers Interested in Data". It's a group that consists of Five College students with cross-interdisciplinary backgrounds who have an interest in Data Science. We're an organization leading a new generation of Data Scientist. The undergraduate researchers perform data analysis every week on Saturday from 3-5pm at the W.E.B Dubois Library. We also host workshops, invite guest speaker, and offer free data consultation. Students primarily work with R Programming, but there are other members who specializes in a diverse range software and programming languages.

As the prior president of the UGRID, I am happy to see a growing interest in data science and statistical analysis.
