Google is the biggest search engine site, but people tend to forget Google is also one of the biggest content and advertising delivery site in the world. So I find it important to learn more about Google Analytics and Adwords because they help improve my websites through data tracking as well as search results. Now obtaining the google individual certification wasn't that hard, but it's also because I have some background in UI and Web Development. Google offers you FREE resources which you can take time to study for obtaining one of their many certificates. In fact, google allows you to play with a free [Google Analytics Demo Account](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/6367342?hl=en) to understand their business value. Overall, it's been a useful experience to learn more about the technology that you use every single day.
