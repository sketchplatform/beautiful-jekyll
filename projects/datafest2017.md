Sadly, we didn't digest my recommendation from last time. Although, winning the same award came as a huge suprise to us. Thank you to my awesome team members and the wonderful judges. Again, it was a blessing to work with large data again with a short time limit.

<h2>What I've Learn From This Entire Experience:</h2>

- A well crafted story and having a silver tongue is an important to a data science competition.
- As data scientist, our job is to make credible and useful recommendations. If people don't listen to us then we're out of a job.
- Knowing your audience, again stop and think about who are you presenting your findings to.
- When working with big data it's important to have carefully crafted data wrangling skills, one of the most important tool in your arsenal.
- Tools such as Amazon Web Services can be a great help to boosting CPU or memmory performance.
- Software such as Tableau is great for making data visualization on the fly. It is also quite handy for data exploration. 
- Unique ideas are a double edge sword; there were groups with excellent presentations, but fell a bit short because they were lacking a strong data analysis. 
- One team created a personalized story, but it was better fit for "social science" point of view rather than a "data science" point of view.
- There are some team more heavy on the technical side, computer scientists like to utilize data to build something out of it rather than make analysis.
- Nothing wrong with building algorithms, but in a short time period. You either build something that works or something that doesn't.

In the end, when looking at Expedia's data and they gave us clicks rather than people. A story is more emotionally driven if we transform those clicks into people. Another topic that we brought up was mobile trends and potential use of outside data. Crafting a relatable and business applicable story helped earn us additional brownie points.
