## Websites

- **[ugrid.info](http://ugrid.info)** - A website that created for my undergraduate data science organization. It's a website used for sharing data science analysis, announcements, and tutorials. 

- **[stuckonfish.com](#)** - An e-commerce website made using wordpress. Currently, the website is not being used by the client. It was a great lesson for purchasing adwords and setting up an online store.

- **[sketchplatform.com](https://www.sketchplatform.com)** - My personal website created with the intent for sharing innovation and design. It is a work and progress, but I hope to finish it my the end of Summer 2017.

- **[vincentylee.com](http://www.vincentylee.com/)** - The central hub that mainly showcases my portfolio.

## Visuals

- **[Tableau Portfolio](http://ugrid.info)** - A tableau portfolio used for data visualization. I spend 30 minutes every week to practice my skills in [makeovermonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk). You can see how my visuals have gotten better overtime with only 30 minutes of practice.

- **[Artworks](#)** - I started using the Adobe Creative Suite when I was in Middle School. Often, friends of mine would come to me for help with design. Sometimes I get unpaid requests for making logos, designing webpages, and creating works of art.

## Programming Projects

- **[Mobile Health Sensing App](#)** - an android app that involves the integration of step detection, activity recognition, text-to-speech, and heart rate monitoring.

- **[Paca Pace](#)** - an android app that involves the integration of RPM detection for cycling cadence. This is a personal project with my partner that took inspiration from the mobile health sensing app.

- **[Stack](#) ** - Web application for financial savings using bootstrap, node.js, and react.js. Honestly, the design and interactivity fell flat. 

## Honors

- **[Datafest 2016](#)** - Reflection on my team's analysis on the Ticketmaster's dataset.

- **[Datafest 2017](#)** - Reflection on my team's analysis on the Expedias's dataset.

- **[Google Analytics and Adwords](#)** - Reflection on my attempt to obtain google online individual certfication.
