## Websites

- **[ugrid.info](http://ugrid.info)** - A website that created for my undergraduate data science organization. It's a website used for sharing data science analysis, announcements, and tutorials. 

- **[stuckonfish.com](https://www.stuckonfish.com/wp)** - An ecommerce website made using wordpress. Currently, the website is not being used by the client. It was a great lesson for purchasing adwords, implementing google analytics, and building an online store.

- **[sketchplatform.com](https://www.sketchplatform.com)** - My personal website created with the intent for sharing innovation and design. It is a work and progress, but I hope to finish it by the end of Summer 2017.

- **[vincentylee.com](http://www.vincentylee.com/)** - A central hub that is use to showcase my portfolio (currently on it!).

## Data Analysis

- **[Homicide Reports, 1980 - 2014](http://www.vincentylee.com/posts/homicide_reports)** - A data exploration on the homicide dataset with prescriptive analytics on homicide prevention.

- **[Human Resource Data Analysis](http://www.vincentylee.com/_posts/2017-03-11-HR_dataset/)** - A basic tutorial analysis on the human resource dataset using decision trees and random forests

## Visuals

- **[Tableau Portfolio](https://public.tableau.com/profile/vincent6778)** - A tableau portfolio used for data visualization. I spend 30 minutes every week to practice my skills in [makeovermonday](http://www.makeovermonday.co.uk). You can see how my visuals have gotten better overtime with minimal time spent.

## Programming Projects

- **[Mobile Health Sensing App](http://www.vincentylee.com/projects/mobile_health)** - An android app that involves the integration of step detection, activity recognition, text-to-speech, and heart rate monitoring.

- **[Paca Pace](http://www.vincentylee.com/projects/paca_pace)** - An android app that involves the integration of RPM detection for cycling cadence. This is a personal project that I made with a partner, we took inspiration from the mobile health sensing app.

## Honors
