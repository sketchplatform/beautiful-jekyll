### My Professional Life

Hello, my name is Vincent and I am a student who consider myself to be a data scientist, designer, and developer. My work as well as my interest falls into learning about new technology and programming. While my hobbies include cooking, performing data analysis, and creating art. My website <a href = "http://www.vincentylee.com/">vincentylee.com</a> is a portfolio that includes all my works and achievements throughout the years. While <a href = "http://www.sketchplatform.com/">sketchplatform.com</a> is created with the intent for sharing creative and innovative ideas alongside the community.


### My Personal Life

- If I am not working, I tend to volunteer or mentor students over the Summer. It sounds cliche, but something about giving back to the community makes me all fluttery inside. Plus the facilities have great central air conditioning. 

- I'm not saying that I am a chef or anything, but I find food incredibily sexy and innovative. If you ever come over try my sweet "Panna Cotta" for dessert.

- Before my little accident, I was an experienced martial artist in Tae-kwon-do (kickboxing). I no longer participate in the sport, but I still incorporate its techniques in my workout regiments.

- I don't have any time to play video games anymore. However, I still follow the latest trends in hardware and design.
