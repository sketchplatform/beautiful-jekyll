<center>
Hello, my name is Vincent and I consider myself to be both a designer and a developer. My work as well as my interest falls into learning about new technology, data-science, and programming. While my hobbies include cooking, analyzing data, and creating new works of art. My website <a href = "http://www.vincentylee.com/">vincentylee.com</a> is a portfolio that includes all my works and achievements throught out the years. While <a href = "http://www.sketchplatform.com/">sketchplatform.com</a> is recently created with the intent for sharing creative and innovative ideas alongside the community.

### My Personal Life

- If I am not working, I love to volunteer or mentor children over the Summer. I know it sounds cliche, but something about giving back to the community makes me all FLUTTERY inside. Plus the facilities have great central air conditioning. 
- I'm not saying that I am a chef or anything, but I find food SEXY and INNOVATIVE. If you ever come over try my sweet "Panna Cotta."
- Busy, busy, busy. I'm pretty sure you want to know all about my personal life, but there's not much to say I am dedicated to my work. I have one-day to recuperate, but instead it is spent on family and friends. The only excuse I have left is to incorperate my visual designs with work.
