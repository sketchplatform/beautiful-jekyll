### My Professional Life

Hello, my name is Vincent and I am a student who consider myself to be both a designer and a developer. My work as well as my interest falls into learning about new technology, data science, and programming. While my hobbies include cooking, performing data analysis, and creating art. My website <a href = "http://www.vincentylee.com/">vincentylee.com</a> is a portfolio that includes all my works and achievements throughout the years. While <a href = "http://www.sketchplatform.com/">sketchplatform.com</a> is created with the intent for sharing creative and innovative ideas alongside the community.


### My Personal Life

- If I am not working, I tend to volunteer or mentor children over the Summer. I know it sounds cliche, but something about giving back to the community makes me all fluttery inside. Plus the facilities have great central air conditioning. 

- I'm not saying that I am a chef or anything, but I find food incredibily sexy and innovative. If you ever come over try my sweet "Panna Cotta."

- Before my little accident. I was a experienced martial artist in Tae-kwon-do (kickboxing). I no longer participate in the sport, but I still incorporate its techniques in my workout regiments.

- I don't have any time to play video games anymore, but I still follow the latest trends in hardware and design.

- Stock portfolios and Chess. These are skills that I have always wanted to master. Occasionally I play virtual simulation of these games. My goal in life is to move pass from "Beginner Level" participant, but it involves alot of critical thinking and being able to predict ahead.
