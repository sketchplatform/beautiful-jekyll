subtitle: Data Scientist, Developer, and Designer
---

Hello, my name is Vincent and I consider myself to be both a designer and a developer. My work as well as my interest falls into learning about new technology, multimedia, data-science, and programming. While my hobbies include cooking, interacting with data, and creating new works of art. My website vincentylee.com is a portfolio that includes all my works and achievements throught out the years. While SketchPlatform.com is recently created with the intent for sharing creative and innovative ideas alongside the community. 

What else do you want to know about me?

### My Personal Life
- If I am not working, I love to volunteer or mentor children over the Summer. I know it sounds cliche, but something about giving back to the community makes me all FLUTTERY inside. Plus the facilities have great central air conditioning.
- I once was a GAMER not too long ago... Sadly, my passion for playing videogames has died out due to age and work.
- I'm not saying that I am a chef or anything, but I find food SEXY and INNOVATIVE. If you ever come over try my sweet "Panna Cotta."
